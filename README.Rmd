## Introduction

Package **medfate** is designed to assist forest scientists to simulate forest functioning and dynamics, using cohort-based description of forest stands. The package provides functions to simulate the following processes:

+ Soil water balance (De Cáceres et al. 2015)
+ Plant hydraulics, transpiration and photosynthesis (De Cáceres et al. 2021)
+ Carbon balance, plant growth, senescence and mortality (in preparation)
+ Forest dynamics (in preparation)

The models are parameterized for species of the Mediterranean region (particularly for Catalonia, NE Spain), but forests with different composition could be modelled with different parameter sets.

## Package installation

Package **medfate** can be found at [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=medfate), where it is updated every few months. Installation from CRAN can be done via:

```{r installation cran, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("medfate")
```

Users can also download and install the latest stable versions GitHub as follows (required package `remotes` should be installed/updated first):

```{r installation github, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("emf-creaf/medfate")
```

Additionally, users can have help to run package functions directly as package vignettes, by forcing their inclusion in installation: 
```{r installation vignettes, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("emf-creaf/medfate", 
                         build_opts = c("--no-resave-data", "--no-manual"),
                         build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Documentation

+ The package includes a number of *vignettes* that illustrate how to run simulation models in **medfate**. 

+ Additional articles regarding parameter estimation and model evaluation can be found at the package [website](https://emf-creaf.github.io/medfate/).

+ Complete documentation of the models included in the package can be found in [medfate's reference book](https://emf-creaf.github.io/medfatebook/index.html). 

## Companion R packages

During the development of **medfate** some functions have been originally placed there and then moved to more specialized packages which evolve together with **medfate**:

  + Package [**meteoland**](https://github.com/emf-creaf/meteoland) allows generating daily weather input for simulation models in **medfate**.
  + Package [**medfateland**](https://github.com/emf-creaf/medfateland) extends **medfate** by allowing simulations to be performed in a spatially explicit context.
  + Package [**medfateutils**](https://github.com/emf-creaf/medfateutils) provides functions to help initializing vegetation, soil and species parameter inputs for **medfate** simulation functions.

The set of R packages are developed and maintained by the [*Ecosystem Modelling Facility*](http://emf.creaf.cat) at CREAF (Spain).

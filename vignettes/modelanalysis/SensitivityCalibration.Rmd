## About this vignette

The present document shows how to conduct a sensitivity analyses and calibration exercises on the simulation models included in package `medfate`. The document is written assuming that the user is familiarized with the basic water balance model (i.e. function `spwb`). 
The aim of the exercises presented here are:

1. To determine which `spwb()` model parameters are more influential in determining stand transpiration and plant drought stress.
2. To determine which model parameters are more influential to determine model fit to soil water content dynamics.
3. To reduce the uncertainty in parameters determining fine root distribution, given an observed data set of soil water content dynamics.

As an example data set we will use here the same data sets provided to illustrate simulation functions in **medfate**. We begin by loading the package and the example forest data:
```{r}
library(medfate)
data(exampleforest)
exampleforest
```
We also load the species parameter table and the example weather dataset:
```{r}
data(SpParamsMED)
data(examplemeteo)
```

## Preparing model inputs
We will focus on three species/cohorts of the example data set:
```{r}
PH_coh = paste0("T1_", SpParamsMED$SpIndex[SpParamsMED$Name=="Pinus halepensis"])
QI_coh = paste0("T2_", SpParamsMED$SpIndex[SpParamsMED$Name=="Quercus ilex"])
QC_coh = paste0("S1_", SpParamsMED$SpIndex[SpParamsMED$Name=="Quercus coccifera"])
```
The data set consists of a forest with two tree species (*Pinus halepensis*/`r PH_coh` and *Quercus ilex*/`r QI_coh`) and one shrub species (*Quercus coccifera*/`r QC_coh` or Kermes oak). 


We first define a soil with four layers (default values of texture, bulk density and rock content) and the species input parameters for simulation function `spwb()`:

```{r}
examplesoil <- defaultSoilParams(4)
x1 <- spwbInput(exampleforest,examplesoil, SpParamsMED, control = defaultControl())
```

Although it is not necessary, we make an initial call to the model (`spwb()`) with the default parameter settings:

```{r}
S1<-spwb(x1, examplemeteo, latitude = 41.82592, elevation = 100)
```

Function `spwb()` will be implicitly called multiple times in the sensitivity analyses and calibration analyses that we will illustrate below. 

## Sensitivity analysis

### Introduction and input factors

Model sensitivity analyses are used to investigate how variation in the output of a numerical model can be attributed to variations of its *input factors*. Input factors are elements that can be changed before model execution and may affect its output. They can be model parameters, initial values of state variables, boundary conditions or the input forcing data (Pianosi et al. 2016). 

According to Saltelli et al. (2016), there are three main purposes of sensitivity analyses:

 + *Ranking* aims at generating the ranking of the input factors according to their relative contribution to the output variability.
 + *Screening* aims at identifying the input factors, if any, which have a negligible influence on the output variability.
 + *Mapping* aims at determining the region of the input variability space that produces significant output values.

Here we will mostly interested in ranking parameters according to different objectives. We will take as input factors three plant traits (leaf area index, fine root distribution and the water potential corresponding to a reduction in plant conductance) in the three plant cohorts (species), and two soil factors (the rock fragment content of soil layer 1 and 2). In total, eleven model parameters will be studied. The following shows the initial values for plant trait parameters:
```{r}
x1$above$LAI_live
x1$below$Z50
x1$paramsTransp$Psi_Extract
x1$soil$rfc[1:2]
```

In the following code we define a vector of parameter names (using naming rules of function `modifyInputParams()`) as well as the input variability space, defined by the minimum and maximum parameter values:

```{r}
#Parameter names of interest
parNames = c(paste0(PH_coh,"/LAI_live"), paste0(QI_coh,"/LAI_live"), paste0(QC_coh,"/LAI_live"),
             paste0(PH_coh,"/Z50"), paste0(QI_coh,"/Z50"), paste0(QC_coh,"/Z50"),
             paste0(PH_coh,"/Psi_Extract"), paste0(QI_coh,"/Psi_Extract"), paste0(QC_coh,"/Psi_Extract"),
             "rfc@1", "rfc@2")
parNames
```

```{r}
#Parameter minimum and maximum values
parMin = c(0.1,0.1,0.1,
           100,100,50,
           -5,-5,-5,
           25,25)
parMax = c(2,2,2,
           500,500,300,
           -1,-1,-1,
           75,75)
```


### Model output functions

In sensitivity analyses, model output is summarized into a single variable whose variation is to be analyzed. Pianosi et al. (2016) distinguish two types of model output functions:
 
 + *objective functions* (also called loss or cost functions), which are measures of model performance calculated by comparison of modelled and observed variables.
 + *prediction functions*, which are scalar values that are provided to the model-user for their practical use, and that can be computed even in the absence of observations.

Here we will use examples of both kinds. First, we define a function that, given a simulation result, calculates total transpiration (mm) over the simulated period (one year):

```{r}
sf_transp<-function(x) {sum(x$WaterBalance$Transpiration, na.rm=TRUE)}
sf_transp(S1)
```

Another prediction function can focus on plant drought stress. We define a function that, given a simulation result, calculates the average drought stress of plants (measured using the water stress index) over the simulated period:
```{r}
sf_stress<-function(x) {
  lai <- x$spwbInput$above$LAI_live
  lai_p <- lai/sum(lai)
  stress <- droughtStress(x, index="WSI", draw = F)
  mean(sweep(stress,2, lai_p, "*"), na.rm=T)
}
sf_stress(S1)
```

Sensitivity analysis requires model output functions whose parameters are the input factors to be studied. 
\begin{equation}
y = g(\mathbf{x}) = g(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)
\end{equation}
where $y$ is the output, $g$ is the output function and $\mathbf{x} = \{x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\}$ is the vector of parameter input factors. Functions `of_transp` and `of_stress` take simulation results as input, not values of input factors. Instead, we need to define functions that take soil and plant trait values as input, run the soil plant water balance model and return the desired prediction or performance statistic. These functions can be generated using the function factory `optimization_function()`. The following code defines one of such functions focusing on total transpiration:

```{r}
of_transp<-optimization_function(parNames = parNames,
                                 x = x1,
                                 meteo = examplemeteo, 
                                 latitude = 41.82592, elevation = 100,
                                 summary_function = sf_transp)
```

Note that we provided all the data needed for simulations as input to `optimization_function()`, as well as the names of the parameters to study and the function `sf_transp`. The resulting object `of_transp` is a function itself, which we can call with parameter values (or sets of parameter values) as input:
```{r}
of_transp(parMin)
of_transp(parMax)
```
It is important to understand the steps that are done when we call `of_transp()`: 

1. The function `of_transp()` calls `spwb()` using all the parameters specified in its construction (i.e. in the call to the function factory), except for the input factors indicated in `parNames`, which are specified as input at the time of calling `of_transp()`.
2. The result of soil plant water balance is then passed to function `sf_transp()` and the output of this last function is returned as output of `of_transp()`.

We can build a similar model output function, in this case focusing on plant stress (note that the only difference in the call to the factory is in the specification of `sf_stress` as summary function, instead of `sf_transp`). 
```{r}
of_stress<-optimization_function(parNames = parNames,
                                 x = x1, 
                                 meteo = examplemeteo, 
                                 latitude = 41.82592, elevation = 100,
                                 summary_function = sf_stress)
of_stress(parMin)
of_stress(parMax)
```

As mentioned above, another kind of output function can be the evaluation of model performance. Here we will assume that performance in terms of predictability of soil water content is desired; and use a data set of 'observed' values (actually simulated values with gaussian error) as reference:
```{r}
data(exampleobs)
head(exampleobs)
```
where soil water content dynamics is in column `SWC`. The model fit to observed data can be measured using the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient, which we calculate for the initial run using function `evaluation_metric()`:
```{r}
evaluation_metric(S1, measuredData = exampleobs, type = "SWC", 
                  metric = "NSE")

```
A call to `evaluation_metric()` provides the coefficient given a model simulation result, but is not a model output function as we defined above. Analogously to the measures of total transpiration and average plant stress, we can use a function factory to define a model output function that takes input factors as inputs, runs the model and performs the evaluation:

```{r}
of_eval<-optimization_evaluation_function(parNames = parNames,
                x = x1,
                meteo = examplemeteo, latitude = 41.82592, elevation = 100,
                measuredData = exampleobs, type = "SWC", 
                metric = "NSE")

```
Function `of_eval()` stores internally both the data needed for conducting simulations and the data needed for evaluating simulation results, so that we only need to provide values for the input factors:
```{r}
of_eval(parMin)
of_eval(parMax)
```

### Global sensitivity analyses

Sensitivity analysis is either referred to as *local* or *global*, depending on variation of input factors is studied with respect to some initial parameter set (local) or the whole space of input factors is taken into account (global). Here we will conduct global sensitivity analyses using package **sensitivity** (Ioss et al. 2020):

```{r}
library(sensitivity)
```

This package provides a suite of approaches to global sensitivity analysis. Among them, we will follow the *Elementary Effect Test* implemented in function `morris()`. We call this function to analyze sensitivity of total transpiration simulated by `spwb()` to input factors (500 runs are done, so be patient):

```{r, eval = params$complete_rebuild}
sa_transp <- morris(of_transp, parNames, r = 50, 
             design = list(type = "oat", levels = 10, grid.jump = 3), 
             binf = parMin, bsup = parMax, scale=TRUE, verbose=FALSE)
```
Apart from indicating the sampling design to sample the input factor space, the call to `morris()` includes the response model function (in our case `of_transp`), the parameter names and parameter value boundaries (i.e. `parMin` and `parMax`). 

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo=FALSE}
if(params$complete_rebuild) {
  saveRDS(sa_transp, file="sa_transp.rds")
} else {
  sa_transp = readRDS("sa_transp.rds")
}
```

```{r}
print(sa_transp)
```

`mu.star` values inform about the mean of elementary effects of each $i$ factor and can be used to rank all the input factors, whereas `sigma` inform about the degree of interaction of the $i$-th factor with others. According to the result of this sensitivity analysis, leaf area index (`LAI_live`) parameters are the most relevant to determine total transpiration, much more than fine root distribution (`Z50`), the rock fragment content in the soil and the water potentials corresponding to whole-plant conductance reduction (i.e. `Psi_Extract`).

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height = 5, fig.align="center"}
plot(sa_transp, xlim=c(0,150))
```

We can run the same sensitivity analysis but focusing on the input factors relevant for predicted plant drought stress (i.e. using `of_stress` as model output function):
```{r, eval = params$complete_rebuild}
sa_stress <- morris(of_stress, parNames, r = 50, 
             design = list(type = "oat", levels = 10, grid.jump = 3), 
             binf = parMin, bsup = parMax, scale=TRUE, verbose=FALSE)
```

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo=FALSE}
if(params$complete_rebuild) {
  saveRDS(sa_stress, file="sa_stress.rds")
} else {
  sa_stress = readRDS("sa_stress.rds")
}
```

```{r}
print(sa_stress)
```

Again, LAI values parameters are the most relevant, but closely followed by the water potentials corresponding to whole-plant conductance reduction (i.e. `Psi_Extract`), which appear as more relevant than parameters of fine root distribution (`Z50`) and rock fragment content (`rfc`). 

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height = 5, fig.align="center"}
plot(sa_stress, xlim=c(0,300))
```

Finally, we can study the contribution of input factors to model performance in terms of soil water content dynamics (i.e. using `of_eval` as model output function):

```{r, eval = params$complete_rebuild}
sa_eval <- morris(of_eval, parNames, r = 50, 
             design = list(type = "oat", levels = 10, grid.jump = 3), 
             binf = parMin, bsup = parMax, scale=TRUE, verbose=FALSE)
```

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo=FALSE}
if(params$complete_rebuild) {
  saveRDS(sa_eval, file="sa_eval.rds")
} else {
  sa_eval = readRDS("sa_eval.rds")
}
```

```{r}
print(sa_eval)
```

Contrary to the previous cases, the contribution of LAI parameters is similar to that of parameters of fine root distribution (`Z50`), which appear as more relevant than the water potentials corresponding to whole-plant conductance reduction (i.e. `Psi_Extract`). 

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height = 5, fig.align="center"}
plot(sa_eval, xlim=c(0,15))
```

## Calibration

By model calibration we mean here the process of finding suitable parameter values (or suitable parameter distributions) given a set of observations. Hence, the idea is to optimize the correspondence between model predictions and observations by changing model parameter values.

### Defining parameter space and objective function

To simplify our analysis and avoid problems of parameter identifiability, we focus here on the calibration of parameter `Z50` of fine root distribution. Below we redefine vectors `parNames`,  `parMin`, and `parMax`; and we specify a vector of initial values.

```{r}
#Parameter names of interest
parNames = c(paste0(PH_coh,"/Z50"), paste0(QI_coh,"/Z50"), paste0(QC_coh,"/Z50"))
#Parameter minimum and maximum values
parMin = c(50,50,50)
parMax = c(500,500,300)
parIni = x1$below$Z50
```

In order to run calibration analyses we need to define an objective function. Many evaluation metrics could be used but it is common practice to use *likelihood functions* . We can use the function factory `optimization_evaluation_function` and the 'observed' data to this aim, but in this case we specify a log-likelihood with Gaussian error as the evaluation metric for `of_eval()`. 

```{r}
of_eval<-optimization_evaluation_function(parNames = parNames,
                x = x1,
                meteo = examplemeteo, latitude = 41.82592, elevation = 100,
                measuredData = exampleobs, type = "SWC", 
                metric = "loglikelihood")

```

### Calibration by gradient search

Model calibration can be performed using a broad range of approaches. Many of them - including simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, gradient methods, etc. - focus on the maximization or minimization of the objective function. To illustrate this common approach, we will use function `optim` from package **stats**, which provides several optimization methods. In particular we will use "L-BFGS-B", which is the "BFGS" quasi-Newton method published by Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb and Shanno, modified by the inclusion of minimum and maximum boundaries. By default, function `optim` performs the minimization of the objective function (here `of_eval`), but we can specify a negative value for control parameter `fnscale` to turn the process into a maximization of maximum likelihood:

```{r, eval = params$complete_rebuild}
opt_cal = optim(parIni, of_eval, method = "L-BFGS-B",
                control = list(fnscale = -1), verbose = FALSE)
```

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo=FALSE}
if(params$complete_rebuild) {
  saveRDS(opt_cal, file="opt_cal.rds")
} else {
  opt_cal = readRDS("opt_cal.rds")
}
```

The calibration result is the following:

```{r}
print(opt_cal)
```

Note that the optimized parameters are relatively close to those of `Z50` in the original `x1`. 
```{r}
cbind( x1$below[,"Z50", drop = FALSE], opt_cal$par)
```
This occurs because these default values were used to generate the 'observed' data in `exampleobs`, which contains a small amount of non-systematic error. 

### Bayesian calibration

As an example of a more sophisticated model calibration, we will conduct a Bayesian calibration analysis using package **BayesianTools** (Hartig et al. 2019): 
```{r}
library(BayesianTools)
```

In a Bayesian analysis one evaluates how the uncertainty in model parameters is changed (hopefully reduced) after observing some data, because observed values do not have the same likelihood under all regions of the parameter space. For a Bayesian analysis we need to specify a (log)likelihood function and the prior distribution (i.e. the initial uncertainty) of the input factors. The central object in the **BayesianTools** package is the `BayesianSetup`. This class, created by calls to `createBayesianSetup()`, contains the information about the model to be fit (likelihood), and the priors for model parameters. In absence of previous data, we specify a uniform distribution between the minimum and maximum values, which in the **BayesianTools** package can be done using function `createUniformPrior()`:
```{r}
prior <- createUniformPrior(parMin, parMax, parIni)
mcmc_setup <- createBayesianSetup(likelihood = of_eval, 
                                  prior = prior, 
                                  names = parNames)
```
Function `createBayesianSetup()` automatically creates the posterior and various convenience functions for the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers. The `runMCMC()` function is the main wrapper for all other implemented MCMC functions. Here we call it with nine chains of 1000 iterations each.
```{r, eval = params$complete_rebuild}
mcmc_out <- runMCMC(
  bayesianSetup = mcmc_setup, 
  sampler = "DEzs",
  settings = list(iterations = 1000, nrChains = 9))
```
By default `runMCMC()` uses parallel computation, but the calibration process is nevertheless rather slow.
```{r, eval = TRUE, echo=FALSE}
if(params$complete_rebuild) {
  saveRDS(mcmc_out, file="mcmc_out.rds")
} else {
  mcmc_out = readRDS("mcmc_out.rds")
}
```
A summary function is provided to inspect convergence results and correlation between parameters:
```{r}
summary(mcmc_out)
```
According to the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic, the convergence can be accepted because the multivariate potential scale reduction factor was ≤ 1.1. We can plot the Markov Chains and the posterior density distribution of parameters that they generate using:

```{r, fig.height=8, fig.width=6.6}
plot(mcmc_out)
```
We can also plot the marginal prior and posterior density distributions for each parameter. In this case, we see a similar `Z50` distribution for the two trees, which is more informative than the prior distribution. In contrast, the posterior distribution of `Z50` for the kermes oak remains as uncertain as the prior one. This happens because the LAI value of kermes oak is low, so that it has small influence on soil water dynamics regardless of its root distribution.

```{r, fig.height=7, fig.width=6.6}
marginalPlot(mcmc_out, prior = T)
```

Plots can also be produced to display the correlation between parameter values.

```{r, fig.height=6.6, fig.width=6.6}
correlationPlot(mcmc_out)
```
 Here it can be observed the large correlation between `Z50` of the two tree cohorts. Since their LAI values are similar, a similar  effect on soil water depletion can be obtained to some extent by exchanging their fine root distribution.

Posterior model prediction distributions can be obtained if we take samples from the Markov chains and use them to perform simulations (here we use sample size of 100 but a larger value is preferred).
```{r}
s = getSample(mcmc_out, numSamples = 100)
head(s)
```
To this aim, **medfate** includes function `multiple_runs()` that allows running a simulation model with a matrix of parameter values. For example, the following code runs `spwb()` with all combinations of fine root distribution specified in `s`.
```{r}
MS = multiple_runs(s, x = x1, meteo = examplemeteo,
                   latitude = 41.82592, elevation = 100, verbose = FALSE)
```
Function `multiple_runs()` determines the model to be called inspecting the class of `x` (here `x1` is a `spwbInput`). Once we have conducted the simulations we can inspect the posterior distribution of several prediction variables, for example total transpiration:
```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=5}
plot(density(unlist(lapply(MS, sf_transp))), main = "Posterior transpiration", 
     xlab = "Total transpiration (mm)")
```

or average plant drought stress:
```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=5}
plot(density(unlist(lapply(MS, sf_stress))), 
     xlab = "Average plant stress", main="Posterior stress")
```

Finally, we can use object `prior` to generate another sample under the prior parameter distribution, perform simulations: 
```{r}
s_prior = prior$sampler(100)
colnames(s_prior)<- parNames
MS_prior = multiple_runs(s_prior, x = x1, meteo = examplemeteo,
                         latitude = 41.82592, elevation = 100, verbose = FALSE)
```

and compare the prior prediction uncertainty with the posterior prediction uncertainty for the same output variables:
```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=5}
plot(density(unlist(lapply(MS_prior, sf_transp))), main = "Transpiration", 
     xlab = "Total transpiration (mm)",
     xlim = c(100,200), ylim = c(0,6))
lines(density(unlist(lapply(MS, sf_transp))), col = "red")
legend("topleft", legend = c("Prior", "Posterior"), 
       col = c("black", "red"), lty=1, bty="n")
```

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=5}
plot(density(unlist(lapply(MS_prior, sf_stress))), main = "Plant stress", 
     xlab = "Average plant stress",
     xlim = c(0,30), ylim = c(0,2))
lines(density(unlist(lapply(MS, sf_stress))), col = "red")
legend("topleft", legend = c("Prior", "Posterior"), col = c("black", "red"), lty=1, bty="n")
```

\value{
Functions \code{hydrology_infiltrationBoughton}, \code{hydrology_infiltrationGreenAmpt} and \code{hydrology_infiltrationAmount} 
return the daily amount of water that infiltrates into the soil (in mm of water). 

Function \code{hydrology_infiltrationRepartition} returns the amount of infiltrated water that reaches each soil layer.
}
\description{
Soil infiltration functions:
\itemize{
  \item{Function \code{hydrology_infiltrationBoughton} calculates the amount of water that infiltrates into the topsoil, according to the USDA SCS curve number method (Boughton 1989).}
  \item{Function \code{hydrology_infiltrationGreenAmpt} calculates the amount of water that infiltrates into the topsoil, according to the model by Green & Ampt (1911).}
  \item{Function \code{hydrology_infiltrationAmount} uses either Green & Ampt (1911) or Boughton (1989) to estimate infiltration.}
  \item{Function \code{hydrology_infiltrationRepartition} distributes infiltration among soil layers depending on macroporosity.}
}
}
\details{
When using function \code{hydrology_infiltrationGreenAmpt}, the units of \code{Ksat}, \code{t} and \code{psi_wat} have to be in the same system (e.g. cm/h, h and cm).

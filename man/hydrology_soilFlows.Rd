\arguments{
\item{soil}{Object of class \code{\link{soil}}.}

\item{soilFunctions}{Soil water retention curve and conductivity functions, either 'SX' (for Saxton) or 'VG' (for Van Genuchten).}

\item{rainfallInput}{Amount of water from rainfall event (after excluding interception), in mm.}

\item{rainfallIntensity}{Rainfall intensity, in mm/h.}

\item{snowmelt}{Amount of water originated from snow melt, in mm.}

\item{sourceSink}{Source/sink term for each soil layer (from soil evaporation or plant transpiration/redistribution)
as mm/day.}

\item{infiltrationMode}{Infiltration model, either "GreenAmpt1911" or "Boughton1989"}

\item{soilDomains}{Either "single" (for single-domain) or "dual" (for dual-permeability).}

\item{freeDrainage}{Boolean flag to indicate that lower boundary condition is free drainage.}

\item{nsteps}{Number of time steps per day}

\item{modifySoil}{Boolean flag to indicate that the input \code{soil} object should be modified during the simulation.}
}
\value{
Returns a named vector with three elements:
  \itemize{
    \item{\code{Infiltration}: water infiltrated into the soil.}
    \item{\code{Runoff}: surface runoff generated.}
    \item{\code{DeepDrainage}: the water draining from the bottom layer.}
  }
}
\description{
Function \code{hydrology_soilFlows} estimates water movement within the soil according to Richards equation.

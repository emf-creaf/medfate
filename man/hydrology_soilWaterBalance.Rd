\value{
Returns a named vector with different elements, depending on \code{soilDomains}. If
  \code{soilDomains == "single"}:
  \itemize{
    \item{\code{Snowmelt}: Snowmelt input (mm).}
    \item{\code{Source/sinks}: Sum of source/sink input across layers (mm).}
    \item{\code{Infiltration}: Water infiltrated into the soil (mm).}
    \item{\code{InfiltrationExcess}: Excess infiltration in the topmost layer (mm) leading to an increase in runoff.}
    \item{\code{SaturationExcess}: Excess saturation in the topmost layer (mm) leading to an increase in runoff.}
    \item{\code{Runoff}: Surface runoff generated by saturation excess or infiltration excess (mm).}
    \item{\code{DeepDrainage}: Water draining from the bottom layer (mm). This quantity is corrected to close the water balance.}
    \item{\code{CapillarityRise}: Water entering the soil via capillarity rise (mm) from the water table, if \code{waterTableDepth} is supplied.}
    \item{\code{Correction}: Amount of water (mm) added to deep drainage to correct the water balance.}
    \item{\code{VolumeChange}: Change in soil water volume (mm).}
    \item{\code{Substep}: Time step of the moisture solving (seconds).}
  }
 If \code{soilDomains == "dual"} the named vector contains the following additional elements:
  \itemize{
    \item{\code{Lateral flows}: Sum of water circulating between micropores and macropores, positive when filling micropores (mm).}
    \item{\code{InfiltrationMatrix}: Water infiltrated into the soil matrix (mm).}
    \item{\code{InfiltrationMacropores}: Water infiltrated into the soil macropore domain (mm).}
    \item{\code{InfiltrationExcessMatrix/InfiltrationExcessMacropores}: Excess infiltration in the topmost layer (mm) leading to an increase in runoff.}
    \item{\code{SaturationExcessMatrix/SaturationExcessMacropores}: Excess saturation in the topmost layer (mm) leading to an increase in runoff.}
    \item{\code{DrainageMatrix}: Water draining from the bottom layer of the matrix domain (mm). This quantity is corrected to close water balance in the micropore domain.}
    \item{\code{DrainageMacropores}: Water draining from the bottom layer of the macropore domain (mm). This quantity is corrected to close the water balance in the macropore domain.}
    \item{\code{CorrectionMatrix}: Amount of water (mm) added to deep drainage of soil matrix to correct the water balance.}
    \item{\code{CorrectionMacropores}: Amount of water (mm) added to deep drainage of macropores to correct the water balance.}
    \item{\code{MatrixVolumeChange}: Change in soil water volume in the soil matrix domain (mm).}

\description{
Function \code{hydrology_soilWaterBalance} estimates water balance of soil layers given water inputs/outputs, including the simulation of water movement within the soil.
}
\details{
The single-domain model simulates water flows by solving Richards's equation using the predictor-corrector method, as described in 
Bonan et al. (2019).

The dual-permeability model is an implementation of the model MACRO 5.0 (Jarvis et al. 1991; Larsbo et al. 2005).

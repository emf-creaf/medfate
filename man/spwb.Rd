\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{\link{spwbInput}}.}

\item{meteo}{A data frame with daily meteorological data series. 
Row names of the data frame should correspond to date strings with format "yyyy-mm-dd" (see \code{\link{Date}}). Alternatively,
a column \code{dates} can contain \code{\link{Date}} or \code{\link{POSIXct}} classes.
The following columns are required and cannot have missing values:
  \itemize{
    \item{\code{MinTemperature}: Minimum temperature (in degrees Celsius).}
    \item{\code{MaxTemperature}: Maximum temperature (in degrees Celsius).}
    \item{\code{Precipitation}: Precipitation (in mm).}
  }
The following columns are required but can contain missing values (NOTE: missing values will raise warnings):
  \itemize{
    \item{\code{MinRelativeHumidity}: Minimum relative humidity (in percent).}
    \item{\code{MaxRelativeHumidity}: Maximum relative humidity (in percent).}
    \item{\code{Radiation}: Solar radiation (in MJ/m2/day).}
  }
The following columns are optional:
  \itemize{
    \item{\code{WindSpeed}: Above-canopy wind speed (in m/s). This column may not exist, or can be left with \code{NA} values. In both cases simulations will assume a constant value specified in \code{\link{defaultControl}}.}
    \item{\code{CO2}: Atmospheric (above-canopy) CO2 concentration (in ppm). This column may not exist, or can be left with \code{NA} values. In both cases simulations will assume a constant value specified in \code{\link{defaultControl}}.}
    \item{\code{Patm}: Atmospheric pressure (in kPa). This column may not exist, or can be left with \code{NA} values. In both cases, a value is estimated from elevation.}
  }}

\item{latitude}{Latitude (in degrees).}

\item{elevation, slope, aspect}{Elevation above sea level (in m), slope (in degrees) and aspect (in degrees from North).}

\item{CO2ByYear}{A named numeric vector with years as names and atmospheric CO2 concentration (in ppm) as values. Used to specify annual changes in CO2 concentration along the simulation (as an alternative to specifying daily values in \code{meteo}).}

\item{W}{A matrix with the same number of rows as \code{meteo} and as many columns as soil layers, containing the soil moisture of each layer as proportion of field capacity.}

\item{canopyEvaporation}{A vector of daily canopy evaporation (from interception) values (mm). The length should match the number of rows in \code{meteo}.}

\item{snowMelt}{A vector of daily snow melt values (mm). The length should match the number of rows in \code{meteo}.}

\item{soilEvaporation}{A vector of daily bare soil evaporation values (mm). The length should match the number of rows in \code{meteo}.}

\description{
Function \code{spwb()} is a water balance model that determines changes in soil moisture, 
soil water potentials, plant transpiration and drought stress at daily steps for a given forest stand 
during a period specified in the input climatic data. Function \code{pwb()} performs plant water balance 
only (i.e. soil moisture dynamics is an input) at daily steps for a given forest stand 
during a period specified in the input climatic data. On both simulation functions plant transpiration 
and photosynthesis processes are conducted with different level of detail depending on the transpiration mode.
}
\details{
The simulation functions allow using three different sub-models of transpiration and photosynthesis:
\itemize{
  \item{The sub-model corresponding to 'Granier' transpiration mode is illustrated by function \code{\link{transp_transpirationGranier}} and was described in De Caceres et al. (2015),
  and implements an approach originally described in Granier et al. (1999).} 
  \item{The sub-model corresponding to 'Sperry' transpiration mode is illustrated by function \code{\link{transp_transpirationSperry}} and was described in De Caceres et al. (2021), and
  implements a modelling approach originally described in Sperry et al. (2017).}  
  \item{The sub-model corresponding to 'Cochard' transpiration mode is illustrated by function \code{\link{transp_transpirationCochard}} and was described for model SurEau-Ecos v2.0 in Ruffault et al. (2022).} 
}
Simulations using the 'Sperry' or 'Cochard' transpiration mode are computationally much more expensive than 'Granier'.

\description{
Functions to compare model predictions against observed values.
}
\details{
Users should provide the appropriate columns in \code{measuredData}, depending on the type of output to be evaluated:
\itemize{
  \item{\code{"SWC" or "REW"}: A column named \code{"SWC"} should be present, containing soil moisture content in percent volume. When \code{type="REW"}, observed values are divided by the 90\% quantile, which is assumed to be the moisture content at field capacity.}
  \item{\code{"ETR"} or \code{"SE+TR"}: A column named \code{"ETR"} should be present, containing stand's evapotranspiration in mm/day (or mm/week, mm/month, etc, depending on the temporal resolution). If \code{type="ETR"} observed values will be compared against modelled evapotranspiration (i.e. sum of transpiration, soil evaporation and interception loss), whereas if \code{type= "SE+TR"} observed values will be compared against the sum of transpiration and soil evaporation only.}
  \item{\code{"LE"}: A column named \code{"LE"} should be present containing daily latent heat turbulent flux in MJ/m2.}
  \item{\code{"H"}: A column named \code{"H"} should be present containing daily sensible heat turbulent flux in MJ/m2.}
  \item{\code{"E"}: For each plant cohort whose transpiration is to be evaluated, a column starting with \code{"E_"} and continuing with a cohort name (e.g. \code{"E_T1_68"}) with transpiration in L/m2/day on a leaf area basis (or L/m2/week, L/m2/month, etc, depending on the temporal resolution).}
  \item{\code{"GPP"}: A column named \code{"GPP"} should be present containing daily gross primary productivity in gC/m2.}
  \item{\code{"LFMC"}: For each plant cohort whose transpiration is to be evaluated, a column starting with \code{"FCM_"} and continuing with a cohort name (e.g. \code{"FMC_T1_68"}) with fuel moisture content as percent of dry weight.}
  \item{\code{"WP"}: For each plant cohort whose transpiration is to be evaluated, two columns, one starting with \code{"PD_"} (for pre-dawn) and the other with \code{"MD_"} (for midday), and continuing with a cohort name (e.g. \code{"PD_T1_68"}). They should contain leaf water potential values in MPa. These are compared against sunlit water potentials.}
  \item{\code{"BAI"}: For each plant cohort whose growth is to be evaluated, a column starting with \code{"BAI_"} and continuing with a cohort name (e.g. \code{"BAI_T1_68"}) with basal area increment in cm2/day, cm2/week, cm2/month or cm2/year, depending on the temporal resolution.}
  \item{\code{"DI"}: For each plant cohort whose growth is to be evaluated, a column starting with \code{"DI_"} and continuing with a cohort name (e.g. \code{"DI_T1_68"}) with basal area increment in cm/day, cm/week, cm/month or cm/year, depending on the temporal resolution.}
  \item{\code{"DBH"}: For each plant cohort whose growth is to be evaluated, a column starting with \code{"DBH_"} and continuing with a cohort name (e.g. \code{"DBH_T1_68"}) with DBH values in cm.}
  \item{\code{"Height"}: For each plant cohort whose growth is to be evaluated, a column starting with \code{"Height_"} and continuing with a cohort name (e.g. \code{"Height_T1_68"}) with Height values in cm.}
}
Additional columns may exist with the standard error of measured quantities. These should be named as the referred quantity, followed by \code{"_err"} (e.g. \code{"PD_T1_68_err"}), and are used to draw confidence intervals around observations.
 
Row names in \code{measuredData} indicate the date of measurement (in the case of days). Alternatively, a column called \code{"dates"} can contain the measurement dates.
If measurements refer to months or years, row names should also be in a "year-month-day" format, although with "01" for days and/or months (e.g. "2001-02-01" for february 2001, or "2001-01-01" for year 2001).
